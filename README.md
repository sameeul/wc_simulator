# wc_simulator
A simple Monte Carlo Simulator for WC 2019
We define win probability by this formula: win_probability = 0.5 + (team_b.rank - team_a.rank)*0.05

We first create a tournament and then add teams to the tournament. Then we create a list of matches and create a point table after simulating the matches.
